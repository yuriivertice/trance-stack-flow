# 2. Abandoning The Stack Notion

Date: 2023-02-14

## Status

Superseded by [6. Stack it is](0006-stack-it-is.md)

## Context

This repo originally started out to be a remix "stack", so you could use it with
the remix create command. However, that comes with a lot of compromises that we weren't
willing to make.

At the very least it would've restrained us to npm for the package manager.

## Decision

Make the repo a github template.

## Consequences

It will be easier to use the repo as a template, and we can use any package manager we want.
